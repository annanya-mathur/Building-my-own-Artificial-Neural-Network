# Deep Learning is outshining due to:-
1) **Big data** which is easier to collect and store.
2) **GPUs** (Graphic Processing Units) are massively parallelizable.
3) **Tensorflow** going hand in hand with keras
4) Improved techniques , softwares and model

**Perceptron :-**
Structural building Block of deep learning.
# Neural Network is Universal Function Approximator
